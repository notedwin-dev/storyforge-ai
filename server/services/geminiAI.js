- Focus on narrative, dialogue, emotions, and character development
- Match the ${tone} tone throughout
- Make it readable and enjoyable for humans
- Consider ${characterName}'s traits: ${characterTraits}
- Use the character description: ${characterDescription}
- Appropriate for ${genre} genre and ${length} length
- NO additional scenes beyond 4
